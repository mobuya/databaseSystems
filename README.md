Disclaimer: This project was completed before I had a deep understanding of the benefits of good coding practices, such as proper variable naming, avoiding magic numbers, and applying design patterns. While this project effectively showcases my database skills, it might not reflect the best coding standards.

However, my more recent projects demonstrate my rapid learning and application of these best practices. You can see significant improvements in my code quality and overall software design. Please check out one of my newer projects [here]([https://github.com/mobuya/softwareeEgineering.git]) to see my progress.

Thanks for understanding!
