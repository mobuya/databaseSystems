# Web Developement and Databasemanagement | Jun23

This project wwas done as part of the Databasesystems course; the goal was to develop a database concept for a given problem domain (mine was a jewlery shop), to realise this concept using Data Definition Language (DDL), to query it using Structured Query Language (SQL) and to access the finished database using Java/PHP.  

Achieved 29 out of 30 points.

*remarks: i attended this course before i was aware of coding conventions like varible names, code organization, single responsibility etc. but i will leave it as it is because comparing this project to my Software Engineering project really shows how much i have progressed in the last year.

Im porud of myself! :)
